# Web Security Basics

As a full-stack developer with a passion for application security, I want to share some basic web security concepts that every developer should be familiar with.

## OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

Here are the top three from the latest list:

1. **Broken Access Control** - Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.
2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Failures related to cryptography which often lead to sensitive data exposure.
3. **Injection** - User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.

## Simple Security Tips

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper CORS policies

More detailed posts on each of these topics coming soon!
